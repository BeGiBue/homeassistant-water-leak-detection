# Configuration reference

## Reopening the configuration

After installation, open **Settings → Devices & services → Integrations → Water Leak Guard → Configure**.

The configuration remains editable and contains:

- **Measurement sources**
- **Notification recipients**
- **Expert settings**

The measurement-source form is also available through Home Assistant's **Reconfigure** action.

Saving a Configure subsection keeps the options flow open. Measurement sources and expert settings return to the main Configure menu; recipient add/edit/remove actions return to the notification-recipient submenu. That submenu includes an explicit **Back to configuration** action.

## Measurement sources

A flow-rate sensor is required. A cumulative consumption sensor is optional but recommended.

The config flow supports:

- direct selection of individual sensor entities,
- selecting a Home Assistant device and choosing compatible entities from it.

Internally:

- flow is normalized to L/h,
- cumulative consumption is normalized to L.

A missing or unavailable flow sensor is not treated as zero flow.

## Slow Leak

Default:

- threshold: 3 L/h
- detection time: 60 min
- reset: 10 min below threshold

Typical purpose: leaking toilet cistern, tiny continuous losses, small fitting leaks.

Slow Leak has its own enable/disable switch.

## Low Flow

Default:

- start threshold: 150 L/h
- detection time: 60 min
- quiet threshold: 20 L/h
- quiet/reset time: 3 min

Typical purpose: a tap left running.

Low Flow has two activation paths in the band **150 L/h ≤ flow < the static High threshold** (default 600 L/h):

- **Long-lasting Low Flow:** the normal 60-minute path remains the safety net, including variable consumption.
- **Particularly steady Low Flow:** enabled by default, activation after 30 minutes of continuous confirmed Low evidence, with a stable trailing 15-minute window.

Steadiness is an additional indication of a tap left open, **not a prerequisite for Low Flow detection**. The reference is the time-weighted median M of the window; tolerance is `max(20 L/h, 0.10 × M)`. At least 90% of confirmed window time must lie within `M ± tolerance`. Both the median and the share use interval duration, not sample count. The oldest interval is trimmed at the window boundary. Credited intervals belong to the current valid report, following F05; the first report in a new chain contributes zero seconds. Different reporting frequencies therefore do not add extra weight; sampling still limits which physical variations can be observed.

Any real report below the Low threshold immediately discards the stability series, including 20–149 L/h and even a short quiet pause. Thus 15 minutes steady, 30 seconds quiet, then 15 minutes steady cannot trigger early activation. The normal Low progress continues under its existing rules until a full quiet reset. A continuous confirmed phase **below 20 L/h for 3 minutes** resets Low monitoring and active Low events (179 seconds does not; 180 seconds does). Existing explicitly saved reset durations, including 7 minutes, remain unchanged.

High-band reports discard Low stability and retain the existing Low/High handover. Unknown, unavailable and invalid values interrupt stability; the returning first report contributes zero evidence. Round7 retains normal confirmed Low progress across same-source outages. Internal ticks supply no evidence. Stability cannot end an already ACTIVE Low event; only its physical quiet/reset condition does. Stability history is transient and is rebuilt after restart; active event persistence is unchanged.

| Expert option | Default |
|---|---|
| `low_stability_enabled` | true |
| `low_stability_early_minutes` | 30 min |
| `low_stability_window_minutes` | 15 min |
| `low_stability_relative_percent` | 10% |
| `low_stability_absolute_lph` | 20 L/h |
| `low_stability_required_percent` | 90% |
| `low_reset_minutes` (only when unset) | 3 min |

When stability is enabled, the window must be positive and no longer than early detection, which must be shorter than normal Low detection. When disabled, the relation between stability times does not block saving; saved times remain intact and are checked again on reactivation. Tolerances must be positive; required share must be >0 and ≤100%. No additional HA entities are created.

Only missing stability times are derived jointly for UI and runtime: `early = min(30, normal / 2)` minutes and `window = min(15, resolved early / 2)` minutes, rounded down to the 0.1-minute UI grid with a 0.1-minute minimum. An explicit early time is used when deriving a missing window. Explicitly stored times are never overwritten. For the UI's normal Low minimum of 1 minute, the derived times remain valid.

| Normal Low detection | Missing early default | Missing window default |
|---|---:|---:|
| 10 min | 5 min | 2.5 min |
| 20 min | 10 min | 5 min |
| 30 min | 15 min | 7.5 min |
| 60 min | 30 min | 15 min |

Low Flow has its own enable/disable switch.

## High Flow

High Flow represents unusually high but potentially legitimate water use.

The start threshold is static and configurable in expert settings (default
600 L/h). Low Flow covers 150 L/h to strictly below this threshold; High Flow
starts MONITORING at the threshold, with no gap. Learned maxima, manual maxima
and hydraulics cannot raise it. Duration, volume, quiet and reset confirmation
rules are unchanged: reaching 600 L/h is not an immediate alarm.

The former High multiplier is hidden and ignored; existing saved values are
preserved. The Burst multiplier remains available without a High-multiplier
comparison. Burst remains adaptive and uses static High in its dynamic floor.

High Flow can be temporarily bypassed. This bypass does not disable Burst Leak.

## Burst Leak

Burst Leak is intended for major failures such as a burst pipe or failed hose.

Detection combines:

- adaptive absolute flow threshold,
- rapid rate-of-rise detection,
- learned household context,
- hydraulic plausibility.

Burst Leak remains active during High Flow bypass.

## High Flow bypass

Backend controls:

- High Flow bypass switch
- High Flow bypass duration number
- High Flow bypass remaining sensor
- `water_leak_detection.start_high_flow_bypass`
- `water_leak_detection.cancel_high_flow_bypass`

The bypass expires automatically and its expiry is persisted across Home Assistant restarts.

## Companion notification devices

Recipients can be selected during initial setup and managed later under **Configure → Notification recipients**. The overview shows the configured display names in a compact list; technical notification-service and tracker IDs remain available in the edit forms instead of being repeated in the overview.

Each recipient is configured independently with:

- display name,
- `notify.mobile_app_*` service,
- matching `device_tracker.*`,
- critical-alert permission,
- global acknowledgement permission while Home,
- optional trusted stationary Home-device flag.

### Personal mute

An authorized notification device can mute the current event for itself.

This does not clear:

- the detector state,
- the event,
- notifications on other devices,
- the shutoff request.

### Global acknowledgement

Global acknowledgement is accepted only when:

- the device is configured to allow it, and
- its assigned `device_tracker.*` currently reports `home`.

Authorization is checked by backend logic, not only by which notification button is shown.

### Trusted stationary Home device

A shared tablet that normally remains Home can be marked as trusted stationary.

This allows the device itself to act as a Home terminal for global acknowledgement without assuming which person is holding it.

### Return Home

When a configured notification device transitions from away to Home while an event is still active and not globally acknowledged, it is notified again.

Any per-device mute for that event is cleared when the device returns Home.

## Adaptive learning

Default learning window: 30 days.

The learner admits completed normal-use episodes and excludes suspicious events and bypass periods.

Confidence states:

- `insufficient`
- `learning`
- `reliable`

The model combines recent and longer-term references to allow seasonal adaptation.

Use `water_leak_detection.reset_learning` to clear normal samples, pending High candidates, confirmed High history and their rollback context.

### Repeatedly confirmed normal High episodes

High remains **static**: default 600 L/h, ACTIVE after 45 minutes **or** 500 litres, reset after 5 minutes strictly below 100 L/h. Learning changes none of these values. Only the existing adaptive normal reference for Burst can benefit.

The ordinary learning path still excludes High MONITORING. A separate gate tracks the peak of a High IDLE → MONITORING episode and creates a pending candidate only at its normal physical MONITORING → IDLE reset. A single episode, such as 750 L/h for 12 minutes, does not enter normal samples. Neither do two episodes.

At least **three** comparable clean episodes must exist in the same `learning_window_days` rolling window (default **30 days**). The exact, symmetric rule for every confirming cluster is `max_peak <= min_peak × 1.15`. For example 750/780/800 or 700/800/805 qualify; 650/850/1400 do not. Sorted bands are evaluated deterministically, including overlapping valid bands, without greedy order-dependent grouping. The 15% boundary is inclusive.

On confirmation, pending members enter the existing normal LearningSample model once, retaining their **original completion timestamps**. Confirmed High history can help a fourth episode qualify immediately if at least three comparable episodes, including the new one, remain in the window. Only the peak is learned: no durations, litre limits or reset times. Existing P95, short/long references, seasonal weighting and `insufficient` / `learning` / `reliable` confidence rules remain binding. Three High samples alone do not bypass insufficient confidence. With sufficient confidence, admitted peaks affect normal reference → Burst multiplier → hydraulic ceiling → adaptive Burst threshold; High stays static.

Bypass is never learning permission. Any High ACTIVE, any other ACTIVE leak, or Burst MONITORING/ACTIVE—including a transient Rapid Rise candidate—permanently disqualifies that episode. Unknown, unavailable, invalid flow, a real excluded evidence gap, source rebind and restart also prevent admission. The engine's existing evidence-gap decision is reused: float/datetime differences within the existing absolute 2-µs tolerance are not gaps; explicit zero credit remains zero. Cancelling bypass during continuing high consumption cannot make it normal. A rejected episode requires the configured physical High quiet reset before a fresh eligible episode. An already-high first report after restore is conservatively rejected.

Running candidates and rejection/quiet tracking are transient. Completed pending candidates and confirmed High history persist as separate optional lists of `{timestamp, peak_lph}`, with no storage-version change. They use the existing F15 bounded, exact-identity clock-rollback context; promotion transfers applicable permissions without retimestamping or duplicate admission. Old stores default to empty High histories. Invalid records and duplicates are ignored; confirmation history is bounded to the latest 4096 entries. Normal samples and both High histories age out using the same window, including immediately after window reduction or restore. Old winter evidence therefore loses its influence naturally without calendar-season rules.

`reset_learning` clears normal samples, both High histories, running tracking and associated rollback permissions. Source changes retain the existing learning neutralization. There are no new options or entities: the fixed three confirmations and 15% band are internal constants; the existing learning window remains configurable.


## Hydraulic settings

Reference defaults:

- nominal diameter: 25 mm / DN25
- static pressure: 3.5 bar

These settings form a plausibility envelope only. They are not an exact theoretical maximum-flow calculation.

## Shutoff request

Each detector can be configured independently to request shutoff.

The **Water shutoff request** entity is independent from acknowledgement.

Typical conservative behavior:

- Slow Leak: no shutoff by default
- Low Flow: no shutoff by default
- High Flow: no shutoff by default
- Burst Leak: shutoff request enabled by default

Physical valve control is intentionally external/opt-in so users can decide which existing `valve.*` or `switch.*` should react.

## Expert settings

The integration options expose detector thresholds, durations, reset limits, bypass duration, hydraulic context, learning parameters, and detector-to-shutoff mapping.

Change these values only with measured household data where possible.

## Measurement validity and navigation

`source_max_age_seconds` defaults to 0 (no artificial gap limit), range 0–3600.
This is the **Maximum credited gap between measurement reports** expert setting.
Only fresh valid flow reports confirm completed intervals; ticks contribute zero.
A positive limit includes equality (60 s counts at a 60 s limit); larger intervals
add zero without removing previously accumulated confirmed monitoring evidence.
Normal subsequent reports count immediately. Automatic mode never learns cadence.
Observed invalid/unavailable/unknown flow breaks the chain; recovery's first report
adds zero. Temporary interruptions of the same source preserve confirmed
Slow/Low/High monitoring progress, clear quiet windows and unconfirmed Burst
candidates, and retain active leaks/shutoff requests. An outage is not zero flow;
actual returned values follow the existing detector/reset rules. Changing the
configured source discards unconfirmed monitoring instead of transferring it.
Without a positive limit, legitimate slow reports and silent communication failures
between valid endpoints cannot be distinguished. See the README for this boundary.
Negative and nonfinite samples are invalid, not zero. Low/High quiet and Burst reset
flow limits remain strictly positive; legacy zero values are clamped to 1 L/h.
Other detector thresholds and detection times are unchanged.

All source, expert and recipient forms provide **Back without saving**. Recipient
changes apply live and preserve detection timers. Source changes rebase meter volume,
reset unconfirmed windows and learning, and retain confirmed safety. See README for
total-meter quantization, parallel HA dispatch and interruption semantics.

F02 is closed. The general learning path excludes High MONITORING and bypass;
a separate repeated-confirmation gate can admit only clean, normally completed
High episodes for the existing Burst reference. F04 and Rapid Rise remain open.
The `effective_high_threshold` entity identity and translation key are retained;
its displayed value stays static.
